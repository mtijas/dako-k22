# DAKO-k22 Group Work

The group work for the Data analytics course in TUAS

## Task and background



## Development environment

There is a `docker-compose.yml` file for those who want to use Docker as their development environment. Our project file `notebooks/dako-gw-grp2.ipynb` is available there, but feel free to use it outside of Docker as well.

The Docker environment can be started simply with `docker-compose -up` and stopped with `^c`.
